Software Engineering, Coding, Web Development, Applications Programming, and more...

After a few years since I was 19 years old (24 today) I've been interested in personal development, business, marketing, sales, and entrepreneurship. All these different topics of interest led me to this point of discovering my passionate interest in creaating websites. I started making websites using Wordpress, Shopify, Wix, and Square.com in order to dropship E-commerce products in my early 20s.

So the actual skill of creating websites from scratch became a keen interest of mine since it helps to know how the business ecosystem works. Actual small and big businesses hire web developers to make BOOMING websites that are filled with psychological tactics that cause consumer minds to explode in online shopping frenzies AKA Jeff Bezo's Amazon.

Coding is the future, and I believe transitioning into a Tech Career will help support my goals, family, network, and be a fun adventure.
**
Ultimately my goal is to do four things for myself in the next 3-5 years:**

1. Get a Job that pays Six Figures
2. Work as a Front End Developer being Excellent at HTML, CSS, JavaScript, & React
3. Learn all it takes to be a Full Stack Developer (for the fun and challenge of it as well as remote work opportunities)
4. Freelance as a Direct Response Copywriter & Marketing Consultant
